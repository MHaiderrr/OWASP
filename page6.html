            <h2>What are Vulnerable and Outdated Components?</h2>
            <p>
                Vulnerable and outdated components refer to software libraries, frameworks, and other dependencies that are no longer supported or have known vulnerabilities. Using such components can expose applications to various security risks, including data breaches and unauthorized access.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Common Types of Vulnerable Components</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Outdated Libraries:</b> Using older versions of libraries that have known vulnerabilities can be easily exploited by attackers.</li>
                <li><b>Unpatched Software:</b> Failing to apply patches for known vulnerabilities leaves systems open to attacks.</li>
                <li><b>Deprecated Frameworks:</b> Utilizing frameworks that are no longer maintained can introduce significant security risks.</li>
                <li><b>Third-Party Dependencies:</b> Relying on third-party components without proper vetting can lead to vulnerabilities being introduced into the application.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Real-Life Example</h2>
            <p>The Equifax data breach in 2017 is a notable example where unpatched software (Apache Struts) led to the exposure of sensitive personal data of approximately 147 million people.</p>

            <h2>Tools for Practice</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Nessus:</b> A vulnerability scanner that helps identify outdated components in your applications.</li>
                <li><b>Snyk:</b> A tool focused on finding and fixing vulnerabilities in open source dependencies.</li>
                <li><b>OWASP Dependency-Check:</b> A software composition analysis tool that identifies project dependencies and checks for known vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ul>
